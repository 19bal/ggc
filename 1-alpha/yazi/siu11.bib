        abstract = {A novel technique for analysing moving shapes is presented in an example application to automatic gait recognition.
The technique uses masking functions to measure area as a time varying signal from a sequence of silhouettes of a
walking subject. Essentially, this combines the simplicity of a baseline area measure with the speci?city of the selected
(masked) area. The dynamic temporal signal is used as a signature for automatic gait recognition. The approach is
tested on the largest extant gait database, consisting of 114 subjects (?lmed under laboratory conditions). Though
individual masks have limited discriminatory ability, a correct classi?cation rate of over 75\% was achieved by combining
information from di?erent area masks. Knowledge of the leg with which the subject starts a gait cycle is shown to
improve the recognition rate from individual masks, but has little in?uence on the recognition rate achieved from
combining masks. Finally, this technique is used to attempt to discriminate between male and female subjects. The
technique is presented in basic form: future work can improve implementation factors such as using better data fusion
and classi?ers with potential to increase discriminatory capability.}

        abstract = {We describe an automated system that classifies gender by utilising a set of human gait data. The gender classification system consists of three stages: i) detection and extraction of the moving human body and its contour from image sequences; ii) extraction of human gait signature by the joint angles and body points; and iii) motion analysis and feature extraction for classifying gender in the gait patterns. A sequential set of 2D stick figures is used to represent the gait signature that is primitive data for the feature generation based on motion parameters. Then, an SVM classifier is used to classify gender in the gait patterns. In experiments, higher gender classification performances, which are 96\% for 100 subjects, have been achieved on a considerably larger database. }
